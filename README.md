# CivilizationGame
A Python-based Civilization game I made for a School programming project

# Description

This is a simple python project I made around 2020. It revolves around various civilizations fighting on the world map, conquering each other.

It also revolves around "population units", which are objects which have a Profession(Slave, Citizen, Tribesman, Nomad), Language, Ethnicity, Culture
and Religion attached to them.
